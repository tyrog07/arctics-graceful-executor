## Introduction

Tired of writing repetitive try...catch blocks? ðŸ˜« graceful-executor is a lightweight, zero-dependency TypeScript utility that simplifies asynchronous error handling.

It provides a clean, consistent way to execute sync or async functions, giving you a predictable [error, result] tuple that eliminates boilerplate code and makes your logic cleaner and more robust.

## Features

- `Centralized Error Handling`: Configure a global error handler and a default return value for your entire application. This is perfect for integrating with logging services.
- `Per-Call Overrides`: Easily override global settings with specific options for individual function calls.
- `Built-in finally`: Use the optional finally callback for guaranteed cleanup actions, like setting loading states, regardless of the outcome.
- `TypeScript-First`: Built with strong types to provide a safe and predictable development experience.
- `Universal`: Works seamlessly with both async and synchronous functions.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @arctics/graceful-executor
